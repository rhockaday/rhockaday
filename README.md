- 👋 Hi, I’m rhockaday
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting, powershell, and developing useful tools for IT professionals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash scripting, python, and Windows PS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripts that help with the automation of patching for applications.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't lol. Nah jk. I'm just not comfortable with that idea yet.
