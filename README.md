- 👋 Hi, I’m @rhockaday
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting, learning how to code, and developing useful tools for IT professionals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash scripting as well as html, css, and javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally whatever. I just want to learn as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't lol. Nah jk. I'm just not comfortable with that idea yet.
